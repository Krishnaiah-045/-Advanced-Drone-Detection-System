# 🚁 Advanced Drone Detection using CNN with ESP32

AI-powered drone detection system using CNN with ESP32 and ESP32-CAM for real-time surveillance and security applications.

## ✨ Features
- Real-time drone detection using Convolutional Neural Network
- ESP32-CAM based image capture and processing
- Servo motor activation for tracking on detection
- Buzzer alert for instant warning notifications
- Detection logs uploaded to IoT server for remote monitoring
- Low-cost embedded AI solution

## 🛠 Hardware Components
ESP32 Microcontroller | ESP32-CAM | Servo Motor (SG90) | Active Buzzer | 5V Power Supply

## 💻 Software & Technologies
**Embedded:** C/C++ (Arduino IDE/PlatformIO) | **AI Model:** CNN (TensorFlow Lite) | **IoT:** HTTP/MQTT protocols

## ⚙️ Working Flow
Servo motor is activated -> ESP32-CAM captures images → CNN detects drone → On detection Buzzer activates + Data sent to IoT server → Timestamp and status logged

## 🎯 Applications
Anti-drone surveillance | Restricted area monitoring (airports, facilities) | Smart security systems | Event security | Wildlife protection

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
Cloud dashboard visualization | SMS/Email alerts | Multi-axis servo tracking | Improved CNN accuracy | Battery monitoring | Mobile app integration
